She gets on with life as a pilot,
She's a loving kinda gal.
She likes watching plays on Sundays,
Tralala tralala...

She likes to use words like 'plonker,'
She likes to use words like 'victory.'
She likes to use words like 'victory.'

She's not too fond of rude people,
She really hates washing dishes,
But she just thinks back to Danes,
And she's happy once again.
